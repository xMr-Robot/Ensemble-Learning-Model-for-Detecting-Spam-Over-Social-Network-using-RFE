# Ensemble Learning Model for Detecting Spam Over Social Network using RFE
 
Social networks are reliable platforms for valued communication mediums and transferring information across the world, and they are used by millions of users every day. Social networks have become a medium for information sharing, but at the same time, they have rapidly become a medium for spreading misinformation, gossip, unwanted messages, advertisements, spoof news, and a variety of other things. Spammers and Non-Spammers are both present on social networks. Spammers typically send advertisements and unwanted messages to users. Currently, unwanted messages are spread by countless users, even if they don’t know that it is spam. A model is present to recognize spammers in social networks. The process is established based on the set of actions and patterns that the user performed and information-based features like URLs, Posts, Replies, Mentions, Tweets, and Retweets. The RFE is used along with five classifiers, namely Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, XGB, and Adaptive Boosting. Data is collected from social networks, and it is implemented using the Sci-Kit Learn library in Python. Performance is measured by TP and FP Rate, precision, and accuracy, and they are used for the evaluation of the present model.
